# guess-my-number

Fixed some game logic, check the console for the correct number. Changed Score logic. The random number is generated and doesn't change during the session. Interactive the message. Reload button works.Implemented Life.Background color changes when you lose or win. Simplfied code, more cleaner code.Working on High score using time function. Working on time function so the random number can change and the Game can be played multiple times.
The game is ready to go
